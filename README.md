# cs331-proj2
Repository for a project for CMSC331 at UMBC.

Website that allows staff advisers to login and set availible appointment times, and students to schedule times for these appointments. 

A livedemo can be found here: http://userpages.umbc.edu/~ferrier1/CMSC331/Project2/, though it is currently non-functional because UMBC changed the way it does student mySQL servers. I'm planning on registering with their new system eventually or finding a replacement server.
